# Algorithms
An algorithm is a step by step method of solving a problem. It is commonly used for data processing, calculation and other related computer and mathematical operations.

# Recursion

## 1) Exponentiation & Recursion

The task is to write a function getRecursionPow(a, b) that calculates getRecursionPow(2, 3) => 8

## 2) Arithmetic Series & Recursion

Write a function getRecursionArithmeticSeries(n) that calculates the sum of numbers 1 + 2 + ... + n

## 3) Factorial & Recursion

The task is to write a function getRecursionFactorial(n) that calculates n!

# Sorting Algorithms

## 5) Stupid sort

Put items in order by comparing the current item with the previous item. If they are in order, move to the next item. If they are out of order, swap them and move to the start.

## 6) Bubble sort

The bubble sort makes multiple passes through a list. It compares adjacent items and exchanges those that are out of order. Each pass through the list places the next largest value in its proper place.
