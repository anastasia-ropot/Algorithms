# Algorithms
An algorithm is a step by step method of solving a problem. It is commonly used for data processing, calculation and other related computer and mathematical operations.

# Recursion

## 1) Exponentiation & Recursion

Exponentiation (power) is an arithmetic operation on numbers. It is repeated multiplication, just as multiplication is repeated addition. The task is to write a function getRecursionPow(a, b) that calculates getRecursionPow(2, 3) => 8

## 2) Arithmetic Series & Recursion

Write a function getRecursionArithmeticSeries(n) that calculates the sum of numbers 1 + 2 + ... + n

## 3) Factorial & Recursion

The task is to write a function getRecursionFactorial(n) that calculates n!

## 4) Fibonacci & Recursion

Write a function getRecursionFibonacci(n) that returns the n-th Fibonacci number.

# Sorting Algorithms

## 5) Stupid sort

Put items in order by comparing the current item with the previous item. If they are in order, move to the next item. If they are out of order, swap them and move to the start.

## 6) Bubble sort

Bubble sort is an algorithm that compares the adjacent elements and swaps their positions if they are not in the intended order. The order can be ascending or descending.
