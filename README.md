# Algorithms
An algorithm is a step by step method of solving a problem. It is commonly used for data processing, calculation and other related computer and mathematical operations.

# Recursion

## 1) Exponentiation & Recursion

The task is to write a function getRecursionPow(a, b) that calculates getRecursionPow(2, 3) => 8

## 2) Arithmetic Series & Recursion

Write a function getRecursionArithmeticSeries(n) that calculates the sum of numbers 1 + 2 + ... + n

## 3) Factorial & Recursion

The task is to write a function getRecursionFactorial(n) that calculates n!

## 4) Fibonacci & Recursion

Write a function getRecursionFibonacci(n) that returns the n-th Fibonacci number.

# Sorting Algorithms

## 5) Stupid sort

Put items in order by comparing the current item with the previous item. If they are in order, move to the next item. If they are out of order, swap them and move to the start.

## 6) Bubble sort

The bubble sort makes multiple passes through a list. It compares adjacent items and exchanges those that are out of order. Each pass through the list places the next largest value in its proper place.

## 7) Shaker sort

Cocktail shaker sort (also known as bidirectional bubble sort, cocktail sort, shaker sort, ripple sort, shuffle sort, or shuttle sort ) is a variation of bubble sort that is both a stable sorting algorithm and a comparison sort. The algorithm differs from a bubble sort in that it sorts in both directions on each pass through the list. This sorting algorithm is only marginally more difficult to implement than a bubble sort, and solves the problem of turtles in bubble sorts. It provides only marginal performance improvements, and does not improve asymptotic performance.
